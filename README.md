## Optical-Character-Recognition

This project aims to find text in simple text images by detecting each letter and comparing them to a given alphabet by evaluating each letter's similarity.

# Detecting Letters
To detect the each letter, firstly find the lower bound for each line:\

Then find each letter's vertical bound:\

After getting the each input letter image, compare them an input alphabet that each letter mapped with its corresponding letter.


Print the most similar alphabet letter that looks like the input letter.
